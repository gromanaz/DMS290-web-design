            <h2>A best-known beauty spot in Fuzhou City</h2>

            <p>
                With a main peak of 925 meters above sea level and a total area of 48 square kilometers, Drum Hill or Mount Gu is the most famous beauty spot in Fuzhou City.
                Listed into the national scenic spots in China, Drum Hill features numerous historical sites and attractive natural beauties. Apart from the central site of Yongquan Temple,
                 there are over 20 scenes in the east part of the hill, dozens of spots in the west, over 50 in the south and 45 in the north. Most of the scenic spots are rocks in diverse postures which are the results of long-tem denudation, weathering, collapse and accumulation in the historical development.
                 Besides, many inscriptions on precipices left in past dynasties are also the highlights in the hill.
