DMS 290 Assignment 02
=====================

Overall, the changes I implemented in Qianya's website were structured to improve the usability of the website as a whole. By improving legibility and readability the intended use of the website - to provide information about the city Fuzhou - becomes easier for the audience to reach.

Changes in layout/positioning
-----------------------------
My main goal for repositioning the elements on the screen was to make it easier for the reader's eye to find the visual focus and be able to use the provided information better. This included:

* "containing" everything within a smaller width in the viewport to help with focus and ease readability
* repositioning the headings/restructuring their visual hierarchy to improve the readability and so that the reader can follow the logical structure behind the design better
* give clear visual cues (borders, boxes) that guide the reader's eye and gather related content together
* balance the text against the images and include enough whitespace

Changes in visual embellishments
--------------------------------
My main goal for changes in the visual design was to find a style that embodies the character of the city the website is about. This was mainly an expansion of the existing design (as I think it fits quite well) and included:

* changing the hrefs in an overall effort to expand the color palette (hrefs, hover, header, subheadings), but base the changes on the existing color palette because the text against background already provides a nice contrast for good readability
* changing the font to improve legibility while being appropriate of the content
* distributing the text better within the available space (line-height, font-size) to improve readability
* as above balance all elements on the page through use of borders, margins, padding
