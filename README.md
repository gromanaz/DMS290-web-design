DMS 290 Assignment 02
=====================

Changes in layout/positioning
-----------------------------
My main goal for repositioning the elements on the screen was to make it easier for the reader's eye to find the visual focus and be able to use the provided information better. This included:

* "containing" everything within a smaller width to help with focus
* repositioning the headings, so that the reader can follow the logical structure behind the design better
* give clear visual cues (borders, boxes) that guide the reader's eye and gather related content together
* balance the text against the images

Changes in visual embellishments
--------------------------------
The main goal for changes in the visual design was to find a style that embodies the character of the city the website is about. This was mainly an expansion of the existing design (as I think it fits quite well) and included:

* changing the hrefs thus expanding the color palette (hrefs, hover, header, subheadings)
* changing the font to (hopefully) fit the content better while still supporting legibility
* distributing the text better within the available space (line-height, font-size) to improve readability
* as above balance all elements on the page through use of borders, margins, padding
