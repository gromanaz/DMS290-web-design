        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            Fuzhou, the capital of southeast province of Fujian, also referred to as Rongcheng (city of Banyang trees), is an important southeast coastal city faces East China Sea as well as a nearest capital city of the country faces the island of Taiwan.
            Located in the downstream of Min River, Fuzhou is adjacent to Ningde City, Nanping City, Sanming City and Putian City. The city is heavily populated by Han people, who live harmony with over 20 ethnic minorities of Manchu, Miao, Hui, and so on.
            Just as its Chinese name Fu (福) implies, it is a city full of good fortunes (Fu).
            Fuzhou is one of the first open coastal cities in China. Mawei Fuzhou, the cradle of the modern Chinese Navy, has cultivated Chinese shipping culture. It is both a historic and a cultural city with over two-thousand-year of history.
